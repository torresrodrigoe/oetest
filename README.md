# Oetest

This project was generated for the Open English Dev team!

# Updates made
I worked on the header, with more detail on info of progress, to give a more complete vision of the status of the student at first sight. This was considered for a responsive view too.
Also there is the timer update, and lessons and practices sections with sliders as you requested on the specs.
The project can be tested on Karma.

# Thanks
This is my first job test with this kind of project, I hope to receive any feedback that you can have for me.
Thank you.
